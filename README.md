# Stack Overflow "Perl is still relevant in 2022" blog post 

## Objectives

After initial publication of the [blog post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/07/06/why-perl-is-still-relevant-in-2022/), various comments came out due to the lack of review before the article was published. This repository could help to improve it by: 

- Review [perl article](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/07/06/why-perl-is-still-relevant-in-2022/) on Stack Overflow blogging platform
- Improve the code examples to reflect contemporary practices as of 2022

## How to contribute

- Use the [`perl-article-stackoverflow-july6-2022.md `markdown file](https://github.com/girish1729/perl-article/blob/main/perl-article-stackoverflow-july6-2022.md) for article review and contributions. 
- For code examples, prefer the the `.pl` files.  We'll add them to the article in the end. It will allow to test the code in an easier way.

A [draft version of the article is available](https://github.com/girish1729/perl-article/blob/main/strong-case-for-perl.md), but shouldn't be used for the reviews.
